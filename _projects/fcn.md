<h1>Introduction</h1>
"You are Mike Schmitty, and you are hired to keep watch of the Fulltimate Servos Company complex. The objects in the complex are very varied, from plain white lowercase letters to killer animatronics... and a furry. Your job is to take note of their behavior (not what you do in game) and survive until six in the morning (this is what you do in game).

The company doesn't want to spend much money on paying electricity bills, so a mere full charge from a power supply is the only thing that can keep this place up and running. The job also requires you to be flexible and fast, so good luck."

<h1>What is <i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i>?</h1>
Fulltimate Custom Night is a FNAF fangame, specifically of <i>Ultimate Custom Night</i>. It requires the skills to be flexible, fast, and observant. This game is a combination of Starmapo's <i>Paint's Ultimate Custom Night</i> and KamilFirma's <i>Ultra Custom Night</i>. The twist here is the fact that it's just not FNAF characters, it's <u>literally any character in existence</u>. It is known for its abundant number of characters, its fullness of everybody, great music, ambitious collaborators, and unique characteristics.

Fulltimate Custom Night was created with love, care, and ambition in December 11, 2023 from a desire to make a custom night game with a custom roster of characters pickable from the developers and fans. Original FNAF characters like Freddy Fazbear and Toy Bonnie are kept in the roster as well as internet memes such as Amogus and Morgan Freeman. The developers get to have their OCs in the game too, with UN4YA the Cube, interseer the Angry Russian, or just a recolored Mario. Fulltimate Custom Night is where all cultures meet within a survival horror-like game made on a coding website for kids.

<h1>Developers & Collaborators</h1>

Here are some introductory words from <i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i>'s developers and collaborators...

<h2>mariopuff [founder, game owner, chief coder]</h2>
That's me! I am techically the founder and current owner of <i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i>. I consider this project the most work and effort one I have put in among all the others. Besides FCN, I'm planning to code a WarioWare-esque game called <i>MICROGAMING</i>, a spot-the-anomaly game called <i>ALTERING NIGHT-SHIFTS</i>, and another FNAF fangame called <i>Two Weeks at Momo's</i>. I account for like 75% of the game's making, but I wholeheartedly value all of my team's contributions to FCN too :)

<h2>UN4YA [senior producer]</h2>
"Hello! I am from Earth.. obviously. More specifically, I am a mildly autistic, mildly insane teenager from Bangladesh. I consider myself quite the nerd. I also consider myself a wildcard; one day I can be cooking up some of the most insane shit FCN has seen and the other I'm literally doing absolutely nothing. That being said, I think I am quite the competitive person. As for my contributions to FCN... it's not THAT much. Then again I have been described as "slightly brutally honest' before. To the game itself, I've only really contributed a couple dozen character ideas. However, I have made most of the "infrastructure" (I guess you could call it that) for the spreadsheet, mostly on the statistical side of things, as well as styling. I guess I'm the spreadsheet guy. Oh and music guy. I do music too. I make ridiculously long tracks... for some reason that I don't know, and that nobody ever will. I personally consider myself a fast producer; I did cook up a nearly 5-minute long track in 20 minutes that one time, and I have made a 45-minute track too. If I can make a track longer than 10 minutes, I probably will. I consider myself pretty productive in that regard. I don't know what else to say; I'm kinda bad at interviews. As for Fulltimate Custom Night, in my opinion, I really like what it has become, and to think that it could still be built on and improved massively, really gets me excited about what it will soon become. It is truly an honour to be in the developer team of this game, even if I haven't contributed THAT much to the game itself." -- UN4YA 2025

<h2>interseer (formerly 4unduck) [concept designer, junior coder, junior producer]</h2>
"Hi there! I'm a random person from this planet, as you may have assumed. Well, all of my work for FCN can be characterised by one quote: "It ain't much, but it's honest work". I'm here more for ideas, suggestions, improvements, etc. For example, a lot of the office UI has my concept art or ideas in it. I also used my ancient Scratch skills to help the Man, Mario, code the thermometer shake. I adore what Fulltimate Custom Night has become, and when I look at game footage and see stuff I know I suggested, it always sparks a little bit of joy in me. I don't really take this stuff very seriously though, I'm only here because I have a lot of free time and nothing else to do."
-- interseer 2025

<h2>SeftBunnY [chief artist]</h2>
SeftBunnY serves as the chief artist of the team, known for their laid-back, slightly chaotic, and candid vibe. They radiate a mix of dry humor, blunt honesty, and occasional soft moments—calling someone a “cutie patootie” in one message and exclaiming “gay men” or “ew?” in another. A PC gamer and VRChat enthusiast with a broken M key, they casually share pirated game links, guitar riffs, and random thoughts with a mix of lowercase typing and bursts of keyboard chaos. Whether venting about Clip Studio Paint, practicing “Creep” on acoustic guitar, or reacting to absurd Discord antics, Seft balances irreverence with creative energy, often disappearing mid-convo with a simple “im out.”

<h2>DefinitelyDinkey [senior artist]</h2>
DefinitelyDinkey is the senior artist of the group, bringing a wild and creative energy to every project they touch. As a furry artist who embraces any pronouns, they’re the type to drop unexpected gems like “PUSSY” and “FLINT AND STEEL 🗣️🔥” while also being the one to dig into complicated gameplay, artwork, and school struggles with equal passion. Whether they’re sharing their journey of learning to draw realistic portraits or ranting about their biology exam, Dinkey adds a dynamic, chaotic vibe to every conversation. Their artistic flair and unpredictable nature make them a key player in the team, always ready to create something new — and just as likely to drop a meme at any moment.

<h2>beepybunny [game ripper]</h2>
beepybunny is a dedicated and passionate game ripper who thrives on the adrenaline of intense gaming sessions and the challenge of uncovering hidden details within complex FNAF fangames. His approach to the game mirrors that of a competitive racer — focused, determined, and always pushing himself to get the most out of every task. Beepy often takes a deep dive into the game’s mechanics, dissecting every element and exploring character backstories, lore, and hidden secrets. His passion for these details can sometimes lead to moments of frustration when things don’t go as planned, and when this happens, he’s known to blow up. He’ll unleash a flurry of frustration on anyone or anything standing in his way. But it’s this intense drive that fuels his creativity and dedication. Whether he’s passionately discussing gameplay strategies or defending the integrity of a particular character’s arc, Beepy brings an undeniable energy to every conversation. His fiery enthusiasm, while occasionally leading to these outbursts, is exactly what pushes him to excel in everything he does. He’s the kind of person who will pour hours into a game, looking for the perfect way to break it down and share his findings with the team. And despite the occasional blowup, Beepy’s contributions are always invaluable, pushing the team to greater heights with every detail he uncovers.

<h2>CzarIsActual [playtester, junior artist]</h2>
"Hi :)
I am Czar, I do stuff I guess.
What I do in FCN is make some designs for the game, and actually playtest the game as well.
Mariopuff has been a pretty cool person and I am willing to help on what he needs.
Other things I do are playing max modes in FNaF, Platformers, and do some coding as well for other games! I like maths, editing, music, yaoi- excuse me I meant um, hanging out with people!
Thank you for the time reading this, have a good day :D"
-- CzarIsActual 2025

<h2>zxcks2x</h2>
zxcks2x, casually called Issac, is a laid-back, easygoing individual with a strong Roblox presence and a knack for creating chill vibes. A fan of both gaming and pop culture, he enjoys engaging with his friends, often sharing funny moments or thoughts that reflect his relaxed personality. Whether discussing random ideas or just enjoying the Minecraft movie, Isaac is all about the low-pressure fun. He stands out not just for his gaming skills but for his vibrant, lighthearted approach to life, which shows in his playful, witty exchanges. His involvement in the racing community, particularly with the <i>Subminimal Subway</i> crew, highlights his versatility and passion for the things he enjoys.

<h2>itznero [game ripper]</h2>
"Hello! I am the game ripper. Ripping games is kind of my thing. I've only slightly contributed to <i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i>, but I've worked together with mariopuff in his previous games. I've been friends with mariopuff for a while. I am also working on a few other projects, but I am pretty inactive online. That's all, I guess.. I mean it's not like you'll read all of this anyway."
-- itznero (aka tartarsauce) 2025

<br><br>

<h1>Goals & Motivation</h1>
<i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i> started as a small Discord collaboration and grew into a massive creative project planned to involve over 300 characters, along with a lot of game mechanics, and lore contributions. We wanted to celebrate our community's humor, energy, and FNAF fandom by building a wild, customizable night experience. With our strong team of ambitious developers and fans, I, as the father of FCN, am looking foward to a path to stardom for <i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i> and its franchise.

<br><br>

<h1>Features & Functionality</h1>
-- Loads of playable characters with unique mechanics<br>
-- Doors, camera lights, vents, mask, elevator, desk cassette tape & more<br>
-- Custom tablet interface with chat logs, hallucination resets, and node fixes<br>
-- Chaotic & comedic energy blended with strategy and lore

<br><br>

<h1>Reflection</h1>
Working on <i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i> has really taught me a lot of lessons about team management and leadership. I realized how effective and fun working as team is. I also learned over time the great value of my friends' contributions to the project, and from that I am really thankful to my collaborators and fellow developers for making my biggest custom night game project come true!
