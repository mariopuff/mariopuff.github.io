So yesterday I finally showed the game to CzarIsActual, one of FCN's developers and the playtester. They're known for beating custom night games' max modes, and after watching their videos I can say that they are very skilled at custom night games indeed. So I figured I show <i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i> to Czar themself. But we've talked, and I realized the limits that FCN currently has. Since the executable version of FCN (downloadable from Game Jolt) is packaged by Turbowarp, or honestly since FCN itself is a Scratch game to begin with, a lot of lag is noticeable due to Scratch really only be made for simple kid projects. And after some testing, it's true. Every other custom night fangame out there (and even Scott Cawthon's games!) all use Clickteam as the language of code.


As of now, I'm still pretty darn new to Clickteam, and those icons are driving me insane. I mean, I like the use of icons myself, but this interface is too much to handle. But coding isn't as simple as sticking blocks together anymore, so I'll have to get used to coding in Clickteam. If Scott can do it, why can't I?


So, to celebrate the 80 characters being coded into <i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i>, I, with the assistance of my fellow developers, will remake <i>Fulltimate Custom Night</i> in Clickteam 2.5+ from scratch. This is going to take a lot of time, so maybe it'll take another year. But let's hope we can finish this in 6 months or a little more than that.


Oh boy. Here we go again.
