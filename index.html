                    <h2>Fulltimate Custom Night</h2>
                    <p>Fulltimate Custom Night is a FNAF fangame, specifically of Ultimate Custom Night requiring the skills to be flexible, fast, and observant. This game is a combination of 
                        Starmapo's Paint's Ultimate Custom Night and KamilFirma's Ultra Custom Night. The twist here is the fact that it's just not FNAF characters, it's EVERYTHING.</p>

                        server was founded by Mario_184 and co-owned by UN4YA and 4unduck.</p>

                    <h2>UN4YA</h2>
                    <p>The first friend I met when it try to find someone non-OG. Although I found him through a coding Discord server, he doesn't actually know how to code. 
                        I think he was just invited there for nothing. He doesn't have any skill in FNAF-related games, but he masters the gameplay of <i>Minecraft</i>. Yeah, we play 
                        it in the free time. And the surprising thing is he can have full diamond armor like a week from a season release. What a speedrunner, slow down man!</p>

                    <h2>interseer [formerly: 4unduck]</h2>
                    <p>The unexpected friend I made when I was searching through the official Aternos server. Unlike beepybunny, he lives in the Siberian area near Japan. 
                        That tells he is closer to me than beepybunny is. We both knew <i>Jackbox Games</i> when we first met and now he joins UN4YA and I on Minecraft. Aside from 
                        the game, we three also played the first <i>You Don't Know Jack</i> game online. Additionally, I also got a lot of <i>Lethal Company</i> stuff that I wanted to learn from him.

                    <h2>Seft</h2>
                    <p>One of the originals. Not sure when and where I first met them, but they have joined me on a lot of stuff. Non-Binary, so watch out when you use pronouns against them.</p>

                <div class="card friend-4">
                    <h2>beepybunny</h2>
                    <p>One of the originals in my FNAF-Discord experience. I actually didn't talk to him since that time until the seventh day of April 2024. Before that he made a FNAF 2 remake 
                        in Retrostudio for multiple players, and before that he made his UCN fangame, <i>Ultimate Survival Night</i>. He also mentions that he lives in the Siberian area near Mongolia. 
                        Like 4unduck, he really likes <i>Lethal Company.</i></p>
